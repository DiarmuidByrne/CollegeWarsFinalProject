# CollegeWars
College Wars is the End Of Year Project for Kieran Redington and Diarmuid Byrne for our third year Software Development project.
It is essentially a custom card game built in the Unity Game Engine. We used a user created JSON addon that was imported from the Unity Store in order to utilize JSON objects in our C# Scripts. The addon was created by another developer and is publicly open source for all Unity Developers.
Asides from the JSON addon, all other assets were either personally created by ourselves or were default assets that exist on the installation of Unity. 
The main goal of development for this project was to implement a working online turn-based game using Remote Procedure Calls.

Instructions on how to play the game are available from the "Instructions" page available from the in-game Main Menu.

If you have any further queries, please feel free to contact either os us on our college emails
